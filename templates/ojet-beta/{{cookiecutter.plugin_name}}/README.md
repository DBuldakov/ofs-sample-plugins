# README

This template is designed to help you get started with building a plugin using Oracle JET (JavaScript Extension Toolkit).

## Building the code

1. Install Node.js and npm. You can download the installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install the Oracle JET CLI by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @oracle/ojet-cli
    ```

    This will install the Oracle JET CLI globally on your system.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Build the code by running the following command:

    ```bash
   ojet build
    ```

    This will compile the source code and generate the necessary files for the plugin, including a zip file that you can use to install the plugin in Oracle Field Service.

## Installation

Upload the generated zip file to Oracle Field Service to install the plugin.
